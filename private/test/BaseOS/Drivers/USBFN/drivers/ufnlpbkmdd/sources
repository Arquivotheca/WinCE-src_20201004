Module Name:
    sources.

Abstract:
    This file specifies the target component being built and the list of
    sources files needed to build that component.  Also specifies optional
    compiler switches and libraries that are unique for the component being
    built.

!ENDIF

Note on DOSYSGEN: the sysgen process runs "build" on this sources file to
produce a LIB file, even though the end target will be a DLL or an EXE.  This
is because COREDLL, which is linked implicitly to all such targets, can be
componentized and we want to avoid invoking COREDLL APIs that may not be
available after sysgen.  If you want to build and link this target AFTER the sysgen
is complete, comment out the following line -- otherwise you will get a LIB
file.
