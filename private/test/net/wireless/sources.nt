# Add sdk and oak to the NT includes:

# OAK is used to include ce:: template headers: string.hxx, vector.hxx, etc.
#
# SDK is mainly used for bldver.h. Note that sdk/inc cannot be added to the
# path because it contains headers which conflict with the standard NT files.
# Thus includes for sdk headers must be specified with an "inc/" prefix.
