This IDL file is no longer in the dirs so the resulting bthapi.h and bthapi_i.c is no
longer generated with each build.  If you need to generate this file please check out
..\uuid\bthapi_i.c and public\common\sdk\inc\bthapi.h and then run build in this
directory.  Please ensure that the resulting files have proper copyrights etc. and check
them back in.
