/*
Making the driver pageable:
To make the entire driver pageable, set the following flag in the driver's registry key:

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Drivers\BuiltIn\Audio]
    "Flags"=dword:2    <-- Add this

If performance issues in the IST thread are encountered due to paging, it is possible to make portions of the driver
pagelocked while the remainder of the driver remains pageable:

The following pragma defines a section called "PageLocked" which is set to non-pageable.

#pragma comment(linker, "/SECTION:PageLocked,ER!P")

In the source code, to make a section of code nonpageable, put the following line before the code:

#pragma code_seg("PageLocked")

Afterward, you may use the following line to force following code to be placed back in the default
text section:

#pragma code_seg()

Note that there may still be some performance issues if the IST is blocked on a critical section held by other driver
code which is itself pageable. If this is a problem, it's probably easiest to leave the entire driver as unpageable.

FWIW, the wave driver is generally fairly small, so the advantage of making it pageable is minimal.
