Module Name:

    init.c

Abstract:

    This file contains the FSDMGR initialization/deinitialization entry
    points that initiate the loading/unloading other installable file
    system drivers (ie, FSDs such as FATFS.DLL).

    DEVICE.EXE still loads v1 and v2 FSDs and communicates with them via
    their FSD_Init and FSD_Deinit exports, but it also supports new FSDs
    indirectly via this new "FSD Manager", named FSDMGR.DLL.

    DEVICE.EXE detects a new FSD by the existence of an FSD_MountDisk export.
    In that case, it loads FSDMGR.DLL (if it hasn't already), and notifies
    FSDMGR_InitEx of (1) the module handle of the new FSD, and (2) the name
    of the new device (eg, "DSK1").

    FSDMGR.DLL interacts with the new FSD (XXX.DLL) through the following
    interfaces, which XXX.DLL must export:

      XXX_MountDisk(PDSK pDsk)

        Mounts the specified disk, returning TRUE if success, FALSE if error.
        The FSD must be able to cope with this call being issued redundantly
        (ie, it must determine from the media itself, not the uniqueness of
        the given DSK pointer, whether or not this disk has already been mounted).
        This is due to the nature of removable media and the fact that media
        may or may not have been removed -- or may have changed slots -- while
        the system was powered off.

        All I/O to the disk must be performed via calls to FSDMGR_ReadDisk and
        FSDMGR_WriteDisk in FSDMGR.DLL.  Similarly, FSDMGR_RegisterVolume should
        be used to register each volume present on the disk with the file system.

        Note that this function must also be exported as "FSD_MountDisk".

      XXX_UnmountDisk(PDSK pDsk)

        Unmounts the specified disk.  Returns TRUE if XXX.DLL successfully
        unmounted the disk, FALSE if not.  A requirement of returning
        TRUE is that all volumes on the disk previously registered with
        FSDMGR_RegisterVolume must first be deregistered with FSDMGR_DeregisterVolume.

        Note that this function must also be exported as "FSD_UnmountDisk".

    These rest of these exports define the functionality of the FSD.  Any
    function not exported is replaced with a stub function in FSDMGR that returns
    failure.

      XXX_CloseVolume
      XXX_CreateDirectoryW
      XXX_RemoveDirectoryW
      XXX_GetFileAttributesW
      XXX_SetFileAttributesW
      XXX_DeleteFileW
      XXX_MoveFileW
      XXX_DeleteAndRenameFileW (formerly known as "PrestoChangoFileName")
      XXX_GetDiskFreeSpaceW (formerly known as "GetDiskFreeSpace")
      XXX_Notify
      XXX_RegisterFileSystemFunction
      XXX_CreateFileW
      XXX_CloseFile
      XXX_ReadFile
      XXX_WriteFile
      XXX_GetFileSize
      XXX_SetFilePointer
      XXX_GetFileInformationByHandle
      XXX_FlushFileBuffers
      XXX_GetFileTime
      XXX_SetFileTime
      XXX_SetEndOfFile
      XXX_DeviceIoControl
      XXX_ReadFileWithSeek
      XXX_WriteFileWithSeek
      XXX_FindFirstFileW
      XXX_FindNextFileW
      XXX_FindClose

    There are also some noteworthy omissions.  We neither look for nor install handlers
    for the following APIs because they were not supported after v1.0:

      XXX_CeRegisterFileSystemNotification

    Similarly, the following APIs were not supported after v2.0:

      XXX_CeOidGetInfo

    And last but not least, XXX_CloseAllFiles is not supported because FSDMGR.DLL can
    enumerate all known handles for a given process and call XXX_CloseFile, eliminating
    the need for a special process termination handler.
