*seccook.c - defines buffer overrun security cookie
*
*Purpose:
*       Defines per-module global variable __security_cookie, which is used
*       by the /GS compile switch to detect local buffer variable overrun
*       bugs/attacks.
*
*       When compiling /GS, the compiler injects code to detect when a local
*       array variable has been overwritten, potentially overwriting the
*       return address (on machines like x86 where the return address is on
*       the stack).  A local variable is allocated directly before the return
*       address and initialized on entering the function.  When exiting the
*       function, the compiler inserts code to verify that the local variable
*       has not been modified.  If it has, then an error reporting routine
*       is called.
*
