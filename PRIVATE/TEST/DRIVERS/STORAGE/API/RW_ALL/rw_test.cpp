  Function:
        
    FindNextDevice

  Description:

    If DSKx: is a known valid device, this function will search for another
    device, DSK(>x):. This is useful in the following situation:
        
        1. Insert a card (this is DSK1:)
        2. Insert another card (this is DSK2:)
        3. Remove the first card. Now the only card in the system is DSK2:.
        4. Hard-coding "DSK1:" into the test program will cause an error
           in this situation.

  Arguments:

    DWORD i: This is the highest known device in the system, DSKi:. If you are
             looking for the first device, send in 0. The routine will start
             its search at DSK(i+1):.

  Return Value:

    DWORD: This is the index of the next DSKx: device in the system.

    This routine writes a block of data to the memory card, and times the
    operation.

    dwCurrentSector: the starting sector to be written
    dwNumSectors: the number of sectors to be written
    dwBytesPerSector: the number of bytes per sector

  Return Value:

    This function returns the time it took to write the sectors, in
    milliseconds, if the write was successful (that is, the device driver did
    not return an error code). If the write was not a success, the routine will
    return NULL.
