XNIC

XNIC is the simplest version NDIS miniport driver.
This driver is designed for experimental purpose.



Usage.

Installing card

s d ntapconfig -card-insert xnic
    XNIC1 will come. Since there is no network (and DHCP server),
    the IP address will be resolved to an auto-ip, 169.254.x.x

s d ntapconfig -card-insert XX -dll xnic.dll
    an adapter named XX1 will come.
    You can create as many as NICs you want.

s d ntapconfig -card-eject xnic1
    ejecting XNIC1 (1st instance of XNIC inserted)
    XNIC creates only 1 instance.
    "Inserting couple of times" does not bring multiple NIC instances.

s d ntapconfig -card-insert xnic -static 192.168.2.3
    the NIC will get a static IP, 192.168.2.3.

more options, check 's d ntapconfig -card-insert -?"





Typical usage scenario

s d ntapconfig -card-insert XNIC -static 192.168.1.2
    XNIC1 adapter will come. its IP address will be 192.168.1.2
    This will also create message queue, "X-OUT-XNIC1", and event "X-OUT-XNIC1-START"
    When you give signal the "X-OUT-XNIC1-START" event (use SetEvent()),
    all outgoing packets will be queued to the message queue "X-OUT-XNIC1".
    Read this queue using ReadMsgQueue().
    Currently, the queue can hold upto 8 packets.
    If your application can read and de-queue messages fast enough,
    this 8 buffer will give plenty enough size.

The msgq and event names are constructed from the adapter names, so your apps
can determine their names pretty easily.
The XNIC also writes these names to the registry under HKLM\COMM\<name-of-the-NIC1>
If there is a pre-existing entry in the above registry, XNIC simply sends
the packets to the given msgq.
