#  We only want to build idl and EncDecLib right now -- we
#  do not need the XDSCodec filter as it exists on Win/XP. If
#  we did, we would build the following instead:
#
#  DIRS = \
#      idl      \
#      XDSCodec \
#      dll
#
  
DIRS = \
    idl      \
    dll      \
    EncDecLib
